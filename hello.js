Pakistan remained extremely crucial factor in Indo-US relations during the Cold War era. However, the
effect of Pak factor in US-India relations seems to be waning, as it is no longer as effective as it used to be during
the Cold War period. However, it does not mean that Pakistan has lost its importance as a factor in Indo-US
relations. The issue of F-16 fighter aircrafts that the US was willing to supply to Pakistan and the India‟s objection
to the deal can be cited as one of the latest examples that Pakistan as a factor in Indo-US relations cannot be
completely ignored. The competition and hostilities between the communist bloc led by Soviet Union and the
capitalist bloc headed by the US on the one hand and India‟s vital and firm support for non-alignment, along with its
inclination towards the former due to several factors, made Pakistan closer to the U.S. and “From India‟s point of
view the chief problem was the determined and persistent attempts by Washington to create an artificial parity
between India and Pakistan. This quest had combined with repeated arms aid to Pakistan, some of which was at
times meant to put pressure on India.”1
